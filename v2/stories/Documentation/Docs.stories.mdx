## New York Public Radio's Component Library & Theme System
Radio's open source component library & theme system is built with [Vue3](https://vuejs.org/), [Nuxt3](https://nuxt.com/), [PrimeVue](https:www.primevue.com) & [Primeflex](https://www.primefaces.org/primeflex/). 

### Selecting your theme
In the `.env` file on line 1, update the THEME env var with the name of the theme you want to use. Just use the directory name in the themes folder. `src/assets/themes/`. This theme will be used in the Storybook and Nuxt instances

All other technical instructions are located in the README.md file in the root of this project.
